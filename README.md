# AbishekAmaresanPortfolio

I’m an IT Support and Systems Engineer with hands-on experience supporting enterprise Windows and Linux environments, managing servers, and maintaining reliable IT operations. I’ve worked across Level 1 and Level 2 support, resolving high-volume incidents, administering Active Directory, monitoring infrastructure, and supporting cloud and virtualization platforms.

My background includes supporting 1,000+ end users, managing 30+ servers, and working with tools like ServiceNow, Zabbix, Splunk, and AWS. I’m particularly interested in infrastructure reliability, security, automation, and networking, and I enjoy building home labs to simulate real-world enterprise environments and continuously improve my skills.
